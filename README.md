Udacity Nanodegree Android App (Just Java)

A basic app that lets the user order quick coffee.

The user can enter his/her name, select the number of coffees he/she wants (in a range of 1-100), choose extra toppings like 'Whipped Cream' and 'Chocolate' (which
increase the price accordingly) and then 'Order'. 

The Order thus developed is transferred to an email app with Details of the Order and a subject line. The user will only need to enter the
recipient's address to order some nice coffee!
